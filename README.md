### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 This is a python function that is used to query the sqlite database. 
 To use this function kindly do the following 
   i. there's a segment where I commented that create the new database.  you need to comment it out so the new database can be created. 
   ii, open the file and import the "python_sqlite3_func". this will make you access the function in the "python_sqlite3_func" 
   
   iii. call out each of the function and you have your results
